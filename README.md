# üìñChallenge 2: My Portfolio

## Description:

Contains all files for my portfolio. A website that displays a recent picture, my name, a working links menu, an about me section, a my work section that is linked to my work (placeholder), a contact me section (also linked) and my resume.

## User story:

- AS AN employer
  I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
  SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
  WHEN I load their portfolio
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
  THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
  THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
  THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
  THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## üìù Notes

This is a resubmition. This version is still missing the last point of the acceptance criteria (responsive layout), the About me sec is still a placeholder, the Resume is in spanish and the site can't be deployed at the moment.
The README file is also missing a screenshot.
