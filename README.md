# 📖Challenge 2: My Portfolio
## Description:
Contains all files for my portfolio. A website that displays a recent picture, my name, a working links menu, an about me section, a my work section that is linked to my work (placeholder), a contact me section (also linked) and my resume.  

## User story:

* AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## 📝 Notes

This is a resubmition. This version is still missing the last point of the acceptance criteria (responsive layout), the About me sec is still a placeholder, the Resume is in spanish and the site can't be deployed at the moment. 
The README file is also missing a screenshot.
